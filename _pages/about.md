I'm Chengran Yang, a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate at the [School of Computing and Information Systems (SCIS)](), [Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://www.smu.edu.sg), working under the supervision of [Professor David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) (ACM & IEEE Fellow). My research lies at the intersection of **Software Engineering (SE)** and  **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, focusing on **Harnessing SE Community Knowledge for Developer-Centric Code Intelligence**. My work targets two primary directions:

+ (1) **Improving Code Quality and Security in AI-driven Systems**, specifically focusing on code correctness, runtime efficiency, and vulnerability detection;
+ (2) **Integrating Intelligent Assistants into Developer Workflows**, enabling automated and intelligent support for developer activities, such as automated question answering, documentation generation, and structured code reasoning.

I have 14 publications in top-tier software engineering venues, e.g., ICSE, ASE, TSE, and TOSEM, and received the SMU Presidential Doctoral Fellowship. Before my doctoral studies, I earned my bachelor's degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and interned at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Prof. Jianfeng Zhan.
